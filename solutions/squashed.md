# Solution: Squashed

>!SANDWITCH

After solving some of the bullet pointed crossword clues (which are alphabetized) solvers may notice that the answers are substrings of the answers to the clues at the bottom. In fact, two of the bullet pointed answers can be paired to create one of the bottom answers plus one letter in the middle. Ordering by the bottom clues and extracting the center letters gets us the answer **SANDWITCH**, a fitting punny answer.
