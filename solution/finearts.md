# Solution: Fine Arts

### DONALD JUDD

Each of these "art pieces" are words encryptid with common codes clued by the bordering images. Decrypting all of them will get you the clue phrase `SPECIFIC OBJECTS ART STYLE CREATOR SIX FOUR` which clues the answer **DONALD JUDD**.

|Code|Translation|
|:----:|:----:|
|Morse|SPECIFIC|
|Elements|OBJECTS|
|Braille|ART STYLE|
|Binary|CREATOR|
|Semaphore|SIX FOUR|

## Notes

This puzzle started with the answer DONALD JUDD (obtained by an unfinished meta). I saw that he was an abstract artist and that reminded me of a way to encode semaphore. This is supposed to be an easy puzzle so I thought this is a great idea. Braille and Morse were the two easy ones and binary also was another pretty simple one to think of. I wanted all of them to seem sorta abstract in a sense though some are more obviusly codes than others. I'm not an artist but it was fun to draw the little images, the ear was suprisingly hard to draw for me for some reason. I really liked the final product but my one criticism is that the clue phrase isn't that good. If you search it in whole you don't get the answer, instead you have to search up `SPECIFIC OBJECTS` and from there you can get the answer.
