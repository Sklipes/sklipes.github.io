# Solution: Squashed

### SANDWITCH

After solving some of the bullet pointed crossword clues (which are alphabetized) solvers may notice that the answers are substrings of the answers to the clues at the bottom. In fact, two of the bullet pointed answers can be paired to create one of the bottom answers plus one letter in the middle. Ordering by the bottom clues and extracting the center letters gets us the answer **SANDWITCH**, a fitting punny answer.

## Notes
This is my first puzzle! In retrospect, this puzzle is very bad. I don't think the concept is terrible but this puzzle, mainly its clues, are very scuffed and not polished. I wrote this puzzle for my friend to solve; he solved it but pointed out the many mistakes. The puzzle on the website has been polished _slightly_ but I left some mistakes in. When writing this puzzle I knew I wanted it to be a word puzzle because that's what my friend likes/is good at and I also like them. I settled with this idea which was pretty simple and I liked it. I thought the easiest part was writing the clues but as you can see I was very wrong. I learnt from this to **check your work**, you will most likely have made a mistake somewhere.
